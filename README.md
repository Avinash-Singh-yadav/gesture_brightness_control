## Hand Gesture Brightness Control
✋💡
Control your computer screen brightness using simple hand gestures and your webcam! This project uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to track your hand in real time and adjust brightness based on the distance between your thumb and index finger.

 ## Description📖
This project lets you change your screen brightness by moving your hand in front of your webcam. The distance between your thumb and index finger is mapped to brightness levels—bring them closer for dimmer, move them apart for brighter!
It’s a fun, intuitive way to control your screen without touching your keyboard or mouse.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.10 (64-bit recommended)

Webcam (built-in or USB)

Windows OS (for screen_brightness_control)

## Python Packages:

- opencv-python

- mediapipe

- screen_brightness_control

- numpy
## ⚙️ Installation
1.Clone this repository


```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/gesture_brightness_control.git
cd gesture_brightness_control

```
2. Set up Python 3.10 environment

     (Make sure you have Python 3.10 installed  and selected in VS Code or your terminal.)  
     


3.Install dependencies
```bash

pip install opencv-python mediapipe screen_brightness_control numpy
```
## 🚀 Usage Guide
1.Connect your webcam
Make sure it’s plugged in and not used by another app.

2.Run the script:

```bash
python brightness.py
```
3.How to control brightness:

- Show your hand to the webcam.

- Move your thumb and index finger closer together to decrease brightness.

- Move them farther apart to increase brightness.

- The current brightness level will adjust in real time! 🌞

4.To exit:

- Focus (click) the webcam window and press the q key on your keyboard.


## 📝 Example
This is how the OutPut Looks like

## 💡 Tips
- Good lighting helps the hand tracker work better.

- Works best on laptops and monitors that support software brightness control.

- If you encounter issues, check your Python version and webcam permissions.
